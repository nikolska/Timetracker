# ToDo App with Timetracker
This application uses the REST API.

The application is used to manage a list of tasks, record operations to be performed within a given task, and the time spent by the user carrying out each of them.

For example, the task may be "Grandma's birthday", with the description "Grandma Sofia turns 70 this year!". The operations will be:
- buy birthday decorations
- decorate the living room
- bake a cake
- to prepare food
- invite the family

By clicking on the "+ 15m" or "+ 1h" buttons, we will add the time to the counter that is available for each operation. Thanks to this, after the birthday we will know that baking a cake takes "6h 30m", and inviting a family "45m".

When the task is completed, we can mark it as finished by clicking "Finish". The completed task is read-only - we will not add new operations or time to the current operations. They also cannot be removed.

Tasks can be deleted at any time.
